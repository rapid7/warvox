h3. Installation Notes

<b>Install the plugin:</b>

<pre>script/plugin install git://github.com/jpemberthy/ezgraphix.git</pre>

<b>Run the tasks:</b> (it will move the necessary files to use the plugin)

<pre>rake ezgraphix:setup    # run from your project's root </pre>

After the installation <b>include the FusionCharts.js</b> in each layout that will render ezgraphix:

<pre><%= javascript_include_tag "FusionCharts" %></pre>

and that's it!.

h3. Usage

<b> In your Controller: </b>

<pre>
def index
  @g = Ezgraphix::Graphic.new
  @g.data = {:ruby => 1, :perl => 2, :smalltalk => 3}
end
</pre>

There are 2 ways to <b> pass render options: </b>

<b>1.</b> When the Graphic object is created, you can define it also as: 

<pre>@g = Ezgraphix::Graphic.new(:w => 200, :h => 300, :c_type => 'bar3d', :div_name => 'my_chart_tag_name')</pre>

The defaults are: <pre>{:c_type => 'col3d', :w => 300, :h => 300, :div_name => 'ez_graphic'}</pre>
At the moment, you can render the following graphics:

<pre>
Column 2D => :c_type => 'col2d'
Column 3D => :c_type => 'col3d'
Bar 2D    => :c_type => 'bar2d'
Pie 2D	  => :c_type => 'pie2d'
Pie 3D	  => :c_type => 'pie3d'
Line	  => :c_type => 'line'
Doughnut 2D  => :c_type => 'doug2d'
</pre>

<b>2.</b> Anytime you want, by accessing the render_options attribute.

<pre>@g.render_options(:caption => 'cool languages', :w => 400)  #Merges new options with the last configuration.</pre>

<b> In your view. </b>

Add the following line wherever you want to render the graphic.

<pre><%= render_ezgraphix @g %></pre>

<b> Tests </b>

<pre> rake spec		#run from the plugin's root </pre>

<b> Note.</b>

Full set of render_options are specified in the rdoc, and <b>more chart's support will be included soon!.</b>
