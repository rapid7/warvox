h3. Installation Notes

<b>Install the plugin:</b>

<pre>script/plugin install git://github.com/jpemberthy/ezgraphix.git</pre>

<b>Run the tasks:</b> (it will move the necessary files to use the plugin)

<pre>rake ezgraphix:setup    # run from your project's root </pre>

After the installation <b>include the FusionCharts.js</b> in each layout that will render ezgraphix:

<pre><%= javascript_include_tag "FusionCharts" %></pre>

and that's it!.

h3. Usage

<b> In your Controller: </b>

For single series charts:

<pre>
def index
  @g = Ezgraphix::Graphic.new
  @g.data = {:ruby => 1, :perl => 2, :smalltalk => 3}
end
</pre>

or you can specify the data directly in the constructor:

<pre>
def index
  @g = Ezgraphix::Graphic.new(:data => {:ruby => 1, :perl => 2, :smalltalk => 3})
end
</pre>


For multiseries charts:

In this case you have multiple values for each serie. Also you need to specify categories (labels). In the example below there are 2 series "Registrations" and "Payments" and values are divided into 7 months (labels) with a value for each serie/month.

<pre>
def index
  @g = Ezgraphix::Graphic.new(:c_type => 'mscol3d')
  @g.data = { "Registrations" => [4,2,12,7,0,3,6], "Payments" => [7,3,5,2,1,0,9] }
  @g.labels = ["March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September"]
end
</pre>

You can also pass the data collection to the constructor:

<pre>
  @g = Ezgraphix::Graphic.new(:data => {:ruby => 1, :perl => 2, :smalltalk => 3})
</pre>

There are 2 ways to <b> pass render options: </b>

<b>1.</b> When the Graphic object is created, you can define it also as:

<pre>@g = Ezgraphix::Graphic.new(:w => 200, :h => 300, :c_type => 'bar3d', :div_name => 'my_chart_tag_name')</pre>

The defaults are: <pre>{:c_type => 'col3d', :w => 300, :h => 300, :div_name => 'ez_graphic'}</pre>
At the moment, you can render the following graphics:

<b> Single Series </b>

<pre>
Column 2D	=> :c_type => 'col2d'
Column 3D	=> :c_type => 'col3d'
Bar 2D		=> :c_type => 'bar2d'
Pie 2D		=> :c_type => 'pie2d'
Pie 3D		=> :c_type => 'pie3d'
Line		=> :c_type => 'line'
Doughnut 2D	=> :c_type => 'doug2d'
</pre>

<b> Multi Series </b>

<pre>
MultiSeriesLine		=> :ctype => 'msline'
MultiSeriesColumn3D	=> :ctype => 'mscol3d'
MultiSeriesColumn2D	=> :ctype => 'mscol2d'
MultiSeriesArea2D	=> :ctype => 'msarea2d'
MultiSeriesBar2D	=> :ctype => 'msbar2d'
</pre>

<b>2.</b> Anytime you want, by accessing the render_options attribute.

<pre>@g.render_options(:caption => 'cool languages', :w => 400)  #Merges new options with the last configuration.</pre>

<b> In your view. </b>

Add the following line wherever you want to render the graphic.

<pre><%= render_ezgraphix @g %></pre>

or just

<pre><%= @g %></pre>

<b> Tests </b>

<pre> rake spec	 #run from the plugin's  </pre>

<b> Note.</b>

Full set of render_options are specified in the rdoc, and <b>more chart's support will be included soon!.</b>

<b> Pending </b>

Full and detailed specs.
